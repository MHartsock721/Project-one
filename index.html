      Phillip Bradley Bird (born September 24, 1957) is an American animation director, voice actor, and screenwriter. He is best known for his animated feature films, <em>The Iron Giant</em> (1999), <em>The Incredibles</em> (2004), <em>Ratatouille</em> (2007), and <em>Incredibles 2</em> (2018).</p>

Bird developed a love for the art of animation at an early age and was mentored by Milt Kahl, one of Disney's reputed Nine Old Men. He was part of one of the earliest graduating classes of the California Institute of the Arts alongside John Lasseter and Tim Burton. Afterward, Bird worked as an animator for Disney in <em>The Fox and the Hound</em> (1981) and <em>The Black Cauldron</em> (1985) and wrote the screenplay for <em>Batteries Not Included</em> (1987).

Bird directed his first animated feature film, <em>The Iron Giant</em> in 1999. Although it fared poorly at the box office, it came to be regarded as a modern animated classic. He rejoined John Lasseter at Pixar in 2000, where he developed his second animated film, <em>The Incredibles</em> (2004). He directed his third film, <em>Ratatouille</em> in 2007. Both films place among Pixar's highest-grossing features and gave Bird two Academy Award for Best Animated Feature wins and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay nominations. In 2018, <em>Incredibles 2</em> was released, which Bird wrote and directed. Like its predecessor, the film was a critical and box office success.
